    <h2>1. Introduction — scope &amp; acceptance</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Zoiweb.in. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Zoiweb.in platform (the "Platform"), its websites, mobile sites or apps, products, and services — including but not limited to Social-Welfare, E-commerce, Education, Matrimonial and other services that Zoiweb may add in the future (collectively, "Services").</p>
    <p>By accessing or using the Platform or Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a href="https://zoiweb.in/privacy-policy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.</p>
